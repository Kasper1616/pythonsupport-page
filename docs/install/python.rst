Install Python
==============

In this section, you will find different installation guides that cover the 
same components:

- ``conda`` as the Python package manager,
- Python and packages required for 1\ :sup:`st` year students,
- Visual Studio Code.

Importantly, these installation guides are specifically designed for students who meet at least one of the following criteria:

- First-year Bachelor students at DTU
- Students taking one of:

  - Mathematics 1a/1b (:course-base:`01001`/:course-base:`01002`/:course-base:`01003`/:course-base:`01004`)
  - Computer Programming (:course-base:`02002`/:course-base:`02003`)
  - Physics (:course-base:`10060`/:course-base:`10063`/:course-base:`10065`)
  - Statistics (:course-base:`02402`)

Although tailored for 1\ :sup:`st` year students, these guides are also ideal for anyone needing to use Python.

.. dropdown:: License and terms of use of Anaconda
   :color: warning

   Anaconda/Miniconda defaults to installing packages from the
   Anaconda repositories. There are license restrictions on how
   to use these. Please carefully
   `read them <https://www.anaconda.com/legal/terms/terms-of-service>`__ for your own sake.

   These terms does *not* apply to Miniforge (which is what our guides use)!

   The ``conda`` provided through our installation guidelines will default
   to use the ``conda-forge`` channel (and so are not under the Anaconda
   terms of service). However, one may accidentially follow a guide that adds
   the Anaconda repositories to the available download channels.
   Therefore users should be aware, at install time, where the packages originates from.

      add examples of how this may look

      .. code-block:: shell

         numpy              conda-forge/linux-64::numpy-2.1.0-py311hed25524_0 

      vs.

      .. code-block:: shell

         numpy              pkgs/linux-64::numpy-2.1.0-py311hed257a2_0 

   Note that Anaconda is free to use in teaching (as of 2025) for students.
   For full details of the license, please read them on
   `here <https://www.anaconda.com/legal/terms/terms-of-service>`__.

   See :ref:`here <rec-conda>` for more details.
